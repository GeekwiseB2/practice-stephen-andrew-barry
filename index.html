        <h3>Back in high school, I spent most of my time programming games into either TI-81 or TI-85 calculators.  After nearly twenty years of doing other things not related to coding, such as getting a liberal arts degree, pursuing a career as a fine artist, becoming a medic in the Army, and most recently working in a titanium factory, I have now returned to one of my first loves (minus the calculators), thanks to this opportunity at Bitwise.</h3>
